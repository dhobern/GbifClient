# GbifClient

A client to access species occurrence data using the [download API](https://www.gbif.org/developer/occurrence) of the 
[Global Biodiversity Information Facility](https://www.GBIF.org/) website and to generate data cubes representing 
evidence for the community of species occurring in different units of space and time.  These data cubes hold raw 
evidence for the species distribution and population abundance [
Essential Biodiversity Variables](http://geobon.org/essential-biodiversity-variables/monitoring/) (EBVs). The data cubes 
can also represent seasonal occurrence (phenology) for the species in a given area.
